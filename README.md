This is the repo for the Skooply project.

It contains all code used in running the site.

It currently doesn't contain setup and configuration info for setting up a local development site.

The dev site will be located on the AWS server.

There are three parts to the project.

The HTML, CSS, and JS files for the UI.

The JS files for the client and server side processing.

.Net files for existing customer and vendor loging and validation.

SQL files for creation of the account database. These are currently SQL Server formatted but will migrate to Postgres long term.
